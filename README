Web::Irulan

is a Mojolicious webapp and some associated scripts that assist with
the collection and distribution of SSH host keys from and to client
systems. only OpenSSH clients are supported, though the Data::SSHPubkey
related code could be adjusted to accept and convert public keys in the
PEM PKCS8 RFC4716 forms, if need be

 * client systems can upload their SSH public keys with `irulan-upload`
   (or similar code) at install time e.g. via a package installed during
   KickStart or as part of a virt image
 * the main driver is irulan(1) a command line tool interface to the
   Irulan database; this tool can associate client key uploads with a
   particular host, wraps ssh-keyscan, etc


Quick Use

without any of the web stuff for clients to upload to:

  $ make depend && make test
  ...
  $ perl -00nE '/1 up/ && say' schema/irulan.sql | sqlite3 irulan.db
  $ ./script/irulan keyscan localhost
  ...
  $ ./script/irulan unhosted
  1 FF776C88-BB06-11E9-BF73-33869E4C1D7A localhost
  $ ./script/irulan addhost 1 localhost
  $ ./script/irulan list
  1 localhost
  $ ./script/irulan ssh_known_hosts
  localhost,::1,127.0.0.1 ...
  ...

and then there is rudimentary auditing support (insofar as libssh2
can, though one could instead attempt a full ssh(1) connection to
the hosts(s)):

  $ make ssh-hkaudit
  ...
  $ IRULAN_AUDIT_CMD=./ssh-hkaudit ./script/irulan audit localhost
  ...

periodic diffs of the ssh_known_hosts data might also be good to review,
especially if you setup automatic instead of manual "addhost"
association of systems with hostnames


Customization & Deployment

 * edit web-irulan.conf and customize the authkey value, where the
   database lives, etc (SQLite needs write access to the directory the
   datbase lives in, but ideally not writes access to the Irulan code or
   configuration). if paranoid setup TLS authentication so that the
   client and server better verify one another
 * Web::Irulan will need to be deployed somehow; see the Mojolicous
   deployment docs. MOJO_REVERSE_PROXY may need to be set if Web::Irulan
   is running on some not-/ path
 * irulan(1) will likely need to be available in PATH somehow, and the
   documentation installed to a MANPATH directory
 * edit `irulan-upload` as necessary so client systems can upload their
   SSH keys, or instead only use the keyscan support in irulan(1). there
   is also irulan-client.spec that can build an RPM for RedHat systems
 * cron(8) jobs may be necessary to automatically maintain and check
   various information, or have Irulan itself generate ssh_known_hosts
   on the fly (I do not do that, so that should Irulan break there will
   still a ssh_known_file for clients to get).


Development

  make depend
  make test

full tests require a host running ssh to connect to:

  IRULAN_KEYSCAN=localhost     prove -l t/irulan.t
  IRULAN_KEYSCAN="localhost 2" prove -l t/irulan.t

and then if something is awry probably

  IRULAN_KEEPDB=1      prove -l t/irulan.t
  MOJO_LOG_LEVEL=debug prove -l t/ssh-hostkeys.t

while fiddling with the code; the IRULAN_KEEPDB=1 bit should leave an
irulan.db file somewhere on the system to poke at


TODO

 * add "tags" support so certain hosts can say have a "public" tag and
   everyone can see those, while internal hosts can get the full list?
 * Mojo::SQLite is nice but makes irulan(1) slow to start up ...
 * ssh-hkaudit - change to support connecting to a list of hosts and key
   files instead of one host per invocation


History

this tool replaced the manual collection of ssh host keys, which were
then manually copied into an Ansible repo and then manually checked in
and then manually pushed out to client systems...and sometimes folks
would for some reason forget to do all those steps and there would be
some new host with keys only in ~/.ssh/known_hosts for some user, so
someone else would need to do the above steps, and eventually various
~/.ssh/known_hosts and /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts would differ...
